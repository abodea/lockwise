#  This is a little script to populate Firefox Sync with
#  fake password records.  Use it like so:
#
#    $> pip install PyFxA syncclient cryptography
#    $> python ./upload_fake_passwords.py 20
#
#  It will prompt for your Firefox Account email address and
#  password, generate and upload 20 fake password records, then
#  sync down and print all password records stored in sync.
# 
You always need to change the email, for any usage.
